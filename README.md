# Asset Inventory

**Know exactly what your OpenCode setup can actually invoke — every plugin, skill, command, MCP server, agent, and host capability, each with provenance.**

**asset-inventory** is an OpenCode skill that inventories your setup in one shot — every plugin, skill, command, MCP server, agent, and outer-app capability on your machine, each with **provenance** (where it came from). For every asset it answers three questions: **what it is, who brought it in, how to use it**. 🎯

## 🚀 Quick start

```
/asset-inventory
```

Install the skill (one scope), then invoke it. No configuration needed. Append an argument to target part of your setup — `/asset-inventory mcp`, `agents`, `hosts`, `skills`, `diff`, `usage`. See [Targeting](docs/guides/how-it-works.md#targeting) for what each argument scans and what it writes.

## 📦 Install

> 🌍 **Recommended: install globally.** One copy to install and update, available in every project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sogeisetsu/asset-inventory.git
cd asset-inventory
# copy only SKILL.md + references/ to your skills dir
```

- **Global:** `~/.config/opencode/skills/asset-inventory/`
- **Project-scoped:** `<project-root>/.opencode/skills/asset-inventory/`

### 🤖 Install via AI

Send the text below to your AI and it will install the skill for you:

```
Install the OpenCode skill "asset-inventory" from <https://github.com/sogeisetsu/asset-inventory>.

1. First ask me exactly one question: install globally, or into the current project only.
2. Get the repository with `git clone https://github.com/sogeisetsu/asset-inventory.git` — required; do not fall back to a ZIP download (a ZIP from the Releases page may be outdated).
3. Copy only the two runtime items (SKILL.md and references/) into the target:
   - Global: ~/.config/opencode/skills/asset-inventory/ (Windows: $env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\skills\asset-inventory\)
   - Project-scoped: .opencode/skills/asset-inventory/ inside the current project.
   Create the directory if it is missing. Do not copy the README, docs, or scripts.
4. If the skill already exists at the target, overwrite it (that is an update) — do not ask a second time.
5. When done, verify <target>/asset-inventory/SKILL.md exists, and read the installed version from its frontmatter `metadata.version`.
6. Treat the source as read-only and do not modify any skill content. Report only the install location and the version.
```

## ✨ Highlights

- 🧭 **Provenance** — built into OpenCode, brought by a plugin, created by you, or injected by a host app. A plugin-managed skill is credited to its plugin, never mislabeled "local".
- 🚦 **Five-state labels** — ✅available / ❌disabled / 📦shelf-only / 🚫absent / 🛑broken
- 🔒 **Read-only & masked** — changes no config; masks keys, paths, and private project names by default
- 🖥️ **Host-aware** — binary-scans the app bundle for injected commands that plain grep misses
- 🔀 **Diff mode** — paste the previous JSON and get only additions and removals
- 🌐 **Multilingual output** — the deliverable follows your language (English, Chinese, Japanese, …)
